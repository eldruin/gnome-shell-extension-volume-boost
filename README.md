# GNOME Shell Extension Volume Boost
## Description
Volume Boost is an extension for GNOME Shell that allows you to set
the volume up to 150% from the volume control slider in the status bar
without the need to go to sound settings.

## Installation
Copy these files in your folder `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions`
inside a folder called `volumeboost@extensions.eldruin.com`
Alternatively, you can download these files and execute this command

    mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/volumeboost@extensions.eldruin.com && \
    cp extension.js stylesheet.css metadata.json ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/volumeboost@extensions.eldruin.com

Either way, you will have to restart gnome-shell (Alt+F2 r) and enable
this extension in Gnome Tweak Tool (or through the command line) to
start using it.
